Content:
<joints_name.txt>: list of skeleton joints
<joints-value.txt>: joint Euler angles over time; one frame on each line, each column lists the 3 Euler angles of a given joint over time. Joints follow the order given in <joints_name.txt>
OBJ/: sequence of meshes in OBJ format
maps/wcat/: skinning weights projected on a texture; one tiff file per joint, the skinning weight of a vertex can be retrieved by looking at its texture coordinates and then its value in the corresponding tiff file
